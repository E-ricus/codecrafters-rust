# dns server implementation 

## WIP
Currently is able to fully parse a DNS message, correctly reply for Querys of IN A, and forward the messages to a resolver.
Fully implements the codecrafter solution, but it can be extended.

## Codecrafters

This project started as the solution of the codecrafter's ["Build Your Dns-server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/dns-server/overview).
