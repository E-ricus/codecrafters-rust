# Bittorrent client implementation CLI 

## WIP
Currently can download fully, from the first peer each part one after the other.
Fully implements the codecrafter solution, but it can be extended.

## Codecrafters

This project started as the solution of the codecrafter's ["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).
